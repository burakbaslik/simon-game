# **Simon Game**

## **About**
Simon is an electronic memory game. The game shows a pattern of colored buttons flashing in sequence and the player has to repeat the pattern correctly.

## **Features**
* Increasing difficulty levels with each level.
* Colorful buttons and matching sound effects.
* High scoring.
* There are a certain number of lives.
* The excitement of completing the game in a short time

## **How to Play**
After watching the Simon pattern carefully, choose the same pattern correctly. You get 3 lives in the game. If you repeat the pattern incorrectly or if time runs out, you will lose one life. Try to complete the game without losing all your lives. When you run out of lives, see your highest score.
